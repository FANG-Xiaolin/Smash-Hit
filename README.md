# Smash-Hit

This is a game on PC written in C++ with the help of OpenGL.

## Playing
**Goal:** Pass as many rooms as possible.

All you need to do is to click the mouse.


## Rules
1. If you are hit by any barrier, like moving walls and arrows, your life(shown in the top left) will get minus by **1**. If you are blocked by a door, considering that you may get hurt heavily, your life will get minus by **10**!

2. There will be moving walls and arrows in the scene. You need to click the mouse to shoot the ball in order to destroy those barriers. The number of balls is not unlimited. It is shown on the top left.

3. In order to get more balls, you need to hit the **diamonds**! The diamonds are jumping on the left and right side of the room.

4. When you get to the end of a room, shoot the ball to hit the switch on top of the door to open it.

5. If you want to have a look at the environment, press W/A/S/D to navigate the map.

6. Enjoy!
